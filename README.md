## Made up Story of the Defenders


- Aliens are swarming your planet and abducting whoever they find.
You are the last hope of humanity. The pilot of the newest version of Space ship D3sTr0Y3R-v4.20.
Defeat your enemies and save humans to get that sweet space money.
- With D3sTr0Y3R-v4.20 you can shoot aliens up. You can bomb aliens out of existence.
You can go deep into the Hyperspace and strike your enemy where they do not expect!
- Be careful to not get hit. You only have 3 shots in this. Ship can be only repaired twice!
Since this is the newest version of the D3sTr0Y3R, its hard to find proper parts to fix the ship.
- Now go, be the hero this planet needs. Protect those who are lost, be the light that leads!
